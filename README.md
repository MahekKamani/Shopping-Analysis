### Project Objective(s):
The Online Shopping Analytics project aims to gain actionable insights into customer behavior and transactional patterns within the context of the online shopping dataset. The primary objective was to understand various dynamics, including customer demographics, product popularity, spending patterns, and engagement with promotional activities such as coupons.

### Tools and Technologies:
The project utilized the following tools and technologies:
  - **SQL (Structured Query Language):** The primary language used for data manipulation, exploration, and analysis.
  - **SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS):** For database creation, data parsing, and initial data exploration.
  - **Tableau:** For creating a variety of visualizations and interactive dashboards based on SQL query findings.
  - **Excel:** While not directly used in the project, the dataset obtained from Kaggle was in Excel format, serving as the initial file type for data exploration.

This combination of tools facilitated a comprehensive approach to the analysis, from database creation and exploration using SQL to visual representation and interactive dashboards in Tableau. The dataset's initial format in Excel underscored the importance of diverse tools in handling and extracting insights from real-world datasets.

## Data Visualizations
Transitioning to Tableau, the SQL query findings were used as a basis to create a variety of visualizations. Each visualization aimed to reveal patterns, trends, and relationships within the dataset. Notable visualizations included:
  - **Bar Graphs:** Customer demographics, total sales by product category, highest spending consumer analysis.
  - **Area and Bar Graphs:** Average discount percentage vs total sales throughout the year.
  - **Packed Bubble Chart:** Total spending distribution across locations.
  - **Treemaps:** Product categories by total sales.

The individual visualizations were grouped into five interactive dashboards:
  - **Customer Demographic Dashboard:** Highlights gender distribution by location.
  - **Sales Analysis Dashboard:** Analyzes total sales by product category, transactional patterns, and customer distribution by gender and tenure range.
  - **Location Analysis Dashboard:** Explores total spending distribution across locations and product categories.
  - **Consumer Spending Dashboard:** Focuses on the highest spending consumers and their product breakdown.
  - **Coupon Engagement Dashboard:** Analyzes coupon engagement by percentage and throughout the year.

After receiving feedback, the five dashboards have been consolidated into a comprehensive hub:
  - **Online Shopping Insights Hub:** Integrates all five dashboards into a single interface, offering in-depth analysis of insights and patterns.
